Net primary production fire time series 

To run app you will need to have RStudio installed as well as the shiny, dplyr, and ggplot2 packages installed. To do so run the following command:

install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))

Additionally, you will need to set your working directory where you have saved your files. This can be done with the following code included in the R script:

setwd("/home/marie/portfolio/") # change file path accordingly

Once packages are installed and the working directory has been changed, save the updated code and simply click "Run App" in the upper right corner of the screen. If this does not show up, make sure the code has been saved, it should appear after it is saved.
